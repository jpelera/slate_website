# Welcome to My Website!
Hi My name is John but most of my friends call me <strong>JC</strong>. I am freshman attending Weber State University. My degree is in Computer Science but I also like to do art and travel.<br>
Here are couple of pictures from my recent trip to <em>Cartagena, Colombia!</em> <br>

## Hobbies
My hobbies involve collecting action figures and creating art. My entire collection is valued around $20,000. Art is a way to express myself as I am an individual that doesn't speak much. You can check out photos of my collection and art at my instagram page! <br>

I love listening to different genre of music. I have a particular taste with Japanese music that I highly recommend that you listen to. Here is a link to my spotify playlist.<br>
